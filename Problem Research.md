# Problem Research

It came during the lockdown the whole world was at their home, more and more people went into the idea of growing plants. For example many people were interested in making an internal mini biosphere at their home. However most of the people dont have any experience of taking care of plants. They lacked the proper knowledge of the suitable growing conditions for the plants.

Also with the work from home trend people find less time for these activities or even tend to forget it. The infomation of the water requirements, soil type required, sunlight required .etc was not found in single place and more easily. So, the plants are dying just because of the over watering too.

Seeing this problem we realized to provide people with the help of an application so that they could be guided on how to grow plants and take their necessary care.
